/** Project Settings -> Plugins -> Gas Giant Sim.
 *
 *  WHY THE EDITOR ENTRY POINT IS A SETTING AND NOT A BLUEPRINT.
 *
 *  A Level Blueprint's BeginPlay does not fire outside PIE, so a
 *  blueprint-driven start means entering play every time you want to look at
 *  the field. That is the wrong loop for this stage of the work: the whole
 *  point of the debug view is a fast change-look-change cycle, and PIE round
 *  trips are the slowest part of it.
 *
 *  A setting plus console commands means the sim is running in the editor
 *  viewport from the moment the project opens, with nothing authored and
 *  nothing to remember to trigger.
 *
 *  Blueprint control still exists -- UGasGiantSimSubsystem's StartSimulation
 *  and friends are BlueprintCallable -- and is the right path for shipping,
 *  where a planet actor should own its own sim rather than the project having
 *  one global one. This is a bring-up affordance, and the auto-start defaults
 *  reflect that: on in the editor, off in game. */
