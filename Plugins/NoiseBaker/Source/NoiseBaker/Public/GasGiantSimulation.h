/** The sim's persistent GPU state and the passes that advance it.
 *
 *  Render thread only. Everything it needs arrives through FGasGiantSimParams,
 *  which is a flat copy made on the game thread; this class never touches a
 *  UObject. That is the same split FNoiseVolumeBaker already draws, and for the
 *  same reason.
 *
 *  WHY THE STATE IS POOLED RATHER THAN TRANSIENT.
 *
 *  RDG resources live for one graph. A simulation is defined by state that
 *  survives between graphs, so the vorticity, the streamfunction and the two
 *  reduction buffers are allocated once as pooled textures and re-registered
 *  into each frame's graph. The alternative -- rebuilding from scratch each
 *  frame -- is not a simulation, it is an expensive procedural texture.
 *
 *  THE PING-PONG, AND WHY IT IS TRACKED RATHER THAN INFERRED.
 *
 *  Three passes per substep read the whole vorticity field and write the whole
 *  vorticity field: advect, force and filter. Each therefore needs a distinct
 *  source and destination, so vorticity is two textures with an index that
 *  flips three times per substep. An odd number of flips means the "current"
 *  buffer alternates between substeps, which is why the index is a member
 *  rather than something recomputed from the frame number -- and why every
 *  early-out path below still has to leave it consistent.
 *
 *  The streamfunction needs no ping-pong: red-black SOR updates in place, since
 *  no thread in a sweep reads a texel that another thread in the same sweep
 *  writes. */
