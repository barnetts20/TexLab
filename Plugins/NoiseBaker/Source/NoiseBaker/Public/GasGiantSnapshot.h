/** The profile a snapshot was captured under.
 *
 *  WHY PROVENANCE IS RECORDED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
 *
 *  A snapshot's eddies sit on the jets that existed when it was taken. Restore
 *  it under a different BandCount or JetStrength and they are sitting on jets
 *  that are no longer there -- and because the nudge re-registers the zonal
 *  mean over a few hundred steps, the field will quietly correct itself while
 *  looking wrong in the meantime, then look subtly different from the state
 *  that was captured.
 *
 *  That failure is silent and slow, which is the worst combination. Recording
 *  what the state was baked under lets it be reported at load instead. */

/** A captured simulation state: the whole thing, in two float arrays.
 *
 *  WHY RAW FLOATS AND NOT A TEXTURE ASSET.
 *
 *  A UTexture2DArray carries compression settings, an sRGB flag and mip
 *  generation, and any one of them applied to a physical field destroys it.
 *  Block compression on a vorticity field would be catastrophic and would
 *  present as the sim misbehaving rather than as an import setting -- there is
 *  nothing about a wrong-looking flow that points at a texture group. A float
 *  array has none of that surface: it round-trips exactly, always, and the
 *  entire class of bug is unreachable rather than merely avoided.
 *
 *  It also serialises and compresses perfectly well. At 512x256x3 the pair is
 *  about 3 MB uncompressed, which is small enough to ship a library of them.
 *
 *  WHY BOTH FIELDS AND NOT JUST VORTICITY.
 *
 *  Vorticity alone is the complete state in principle -- psi is recoverable by
 *  inverting the Laplacian. But recovering it means running the cold-start
 *  Poisson solve at load, which is slow, keeps InitPoissonIterations alive as a
 *  runtime concern, and reproduces the captured psi only to solver tolerance
 *  rather than exactly. Doubling the file removes all three. */
