/** Game-thread driver for the flow sim.
 *
 *  WHY A WORLD SUBSYSTEM AND NOT A SCENE VIEW EXTENSION.
 *
 *  A view extension runs inside the render pipeline, once per view. A planet's
 *  weather is world state, not view state: one planet has one flow field no
 *  matter how many viewports, reflection captures or PIE windows are looking at
 *  it, and a view extension would step the sim once for each of them. The
 *  result would be a sim whose rate depends on how many things are rendering,
 *  which is the kind of bug that only appears when someone opens a second
 *  viewport.
 *
 *  The cost is that the work is enqueued from the game tick rather than
 *  scheduled inside the render graph the scene is already building, so it lands
 *  in its own command list. At sub-millisecond that is not worth the
 *  correctness risk.
 *
 *  WHY THE CONFIG IS RE-READ EVERY TICK.
 *
 *  Because the point of this stage is watching the field. Every value in the
 *  config takes effect on the next frame, so the asset can be left open beside
 *  the debug target and tuned live. Only the grid dimensions are latched, and
 *  changing those reallocates and re-seeds rather than trying to resample a
 *  vorticity field onto a different grid. */
 /** BlueprintType is load-bearing, not decorative. K2Node_GetSubsystem only
  *  offers classes marked with it, so without it the "Get Gas Giant Sim
  *  Subsystem" node does not appear in the palette at all and every
  *  BlueprintCallable member below is unreachable -- present in the class,
  *  impossible to call. */
